Apparently, LLM's have some degree of tuning with respect to the emotional variability, responsiveness, and stability of the model. This means that from one model to the next, the personality may seem different. One may be more conversational and "friendly" and another may be more stick-to-business-with-no-fluff, etc. I'm not sure why this didn't occur to me, I assumed this was an emergent characteristic of the dataset and there wasn't a lot you can do about it. but I suppose that's a valuable thing to be able to tune if you're developing a product.
