# what is this

i have this storage layer, sux (stateful-ux) that i wanted to build something around
which would essentially test it so i could flesh out the storage layer with an actual
application. i have kind of a habit of building conversational interfaces, and this
seemed like a good use for a storage backend (i've used postgres in the past, but
this seems like not the best tool to use today). so i created this package, bs (bot-stateful)
to be a test application for my storage layer, which i use in othe projects.

caveat hacker.
